# Particle power monitor

Uses the [Particle](http://particle.io) Photon by default, but probably would work with a Core or one of the other Particle type devices.

Interfaces with a ST STPM34 ADC power-monitoring front-end and is designed for 2 CTs and 2 voltage inputs.  Resistors are sized in general for a 100A â†’ 50mA current transformer, and 120V (US) voltage source.  Unlike the [OpenEnergyMonitor](https://openenergymonitor.org/emon/), we're using a seperate 24-bit ADC, and no voltage transformer.
